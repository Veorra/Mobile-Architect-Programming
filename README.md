**Patrick Valencia's Portfolio**

1) Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The goals and requirements for my application were to be able to show users their current weight and a way to track it. Additionally have a graph created that would help visualize a user's progress towards their goal weight.

2) What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The screens necessary to support the user would be a screen for users to log into. This would log a user into their corresponding accounts by verifying the credentials within the sql database. Additionally, there is an added screen for users to create a new account. 

3) How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I approached my process in coding by a divide and conquer strategy. I would break the overall problem down into the sum of its parts and then work from most important to least important. This technique is incredibly useful and I will keep on using it for my future projects. 

4) How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I tested my code by emulating it on a pixel 2 device as I believe that is the most average hardware for android devices currency. In addition I used an older version of Android to make sure that it was correctly supported through its later versions. This process was incredibly important as it showed both stability and functionality within the program.

5) Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
